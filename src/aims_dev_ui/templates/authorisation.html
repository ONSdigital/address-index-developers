<h2 class="saturn">Authentication</h2>

<p>The Address Index API requires authentication credentials, currently the open test site has basic auth and other sites have JWT tokens and IP whitelists.</p>

<p>To use the general-purpose API you need a whitelisted IP (ONS network already whitelisted) and a JWT token.</p>

<p>To use the bulk service from inside DAP, you need special API key for the CA Gateway.</p>

<p>The Exeter "sandbox" API which is used by this website is not IP restricted but requires basic auth.</p>

<p>A username and password for basic auth will have been given to you by the AIMS support team.</p>

<p>Basic authentication requires the setting of the Authorization header to "Basic " + base64 encoded username and password. </p>

<p>One way to encode the username and password is via the F12 console in your browser: my_auth_string = "Basic " + window.btoa('YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_PASSWORD')</p>

<p>Alternatively, many web frameworks allow the username and password to be passed as parameters when making the API call.</p>

<p>JWT requires the setting of the Authorization header to "Bearer " + token string. </p>

<h2 class="saturn">Example</h2>
